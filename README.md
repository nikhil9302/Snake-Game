# Snake-Game
## Inspiration
There are many inspirations behind this project, this is being my second project, I wanted to make a game again, to better my skills as a game developer. 
I wanted to implement **canvas** programming through this Famous Game which I loved as a child.
## What it does
This prototype does what we expect from a typical Snake Game. Has a better design than the original one, easy controls using _arrow keys_, cheeky old school sound effects.
## How I built it
I built it using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**. Used canvas to create the playground for the game.
## Challenges I ran into
Learning Canvas coding in a short time. Also, there were many preliminary bugs, but it was interesting to debug them. Some bugs that were fixed are synchronizing the sound effects with the game speed, the direction key had to be reset for the New-Game feature etc. 
## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud that within the time duration I could learn and implement canvas coding and make this simple game. As a beginner who just started learning CSS and JS a month ago, making this game has made me use various concepts and it was satisfying to see the end product and excited what the future holds.
## What I learned
I learned Canvas coding, CSS animations, JavaScript OOP, Video recording and editing.
## What's next for Snake-Game
Would like to implement it using game engines, better UX/UI design using Advanced CSS and SASS.
More Game Modes like _Snake in a Maze_ and it has to not touch the walls of the maze.
Make it compatible with mobile devices and Maybe a 3-D snake game in the future.
